                    <h4>[Verse 1:]</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your hair's a mess you better put on a dress and get your feet back on the ground, <br>
                        You fix your eyes for some city guys who wouldn't save you if you drowned, <br>
                        You hang on Forty-second street and do your homework in the bar, <br>
                        Saint Helen says you're missin' school and I'm wond'rin' where you are,
                    </p>
                    <h4>[Chorus:]</h4>
                    <p>
                        Holyanna, <br>
                        Holyanna, <br>
                        Girl, what you do to me, <br>
                        Holyanna, <br>
                        Holyanna, <br>
                        Girl, you're a blue-eyed mystery
                    </p>
                    <h4>[Verse 2:]</h4>
                    <p>
                        You read your books until nobody looks and then you slip out after dark, <br>
                        You steal my love then say you're sorry and do your penance in the park, <br>
                        You fooled your mother when you skipped ballet to paint your face for the midnight show, <br>
                        And in the morning you knelt beside your bed and prayed she'd never know,
                    </p>

                        Holyanna, <br>
