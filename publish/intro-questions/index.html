            Hello! I'm Romina Diaz-Rivero (row - MEE - nah). I like to go by Rome too. <br>
            I'm doing a BFA in Communication Design (Sam Fox) and a minor in Computer Science.
            I'm currently a junior (Class of 2025).

        <li>
            I plan to get into web development and graphic design as a career, so this class is necessary
            for me to understand how to make design and function work together. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I do have experience with front end development. I actually interned at a company called Oasis Digital in
            my freshman year. I mostly did CSS stuff since I use in charge of the design stuff. I would like to hone up
            on my Javascript skills though.
