        <p class="index-intro-p">
          Founded in Oregon in 2005 by President & CEO Travis Knight, LAIKA
          creates films that are born in imagination, shaped into stories, and
          crafted by passionate artists who give life to unforgettable
          characters.
        </p>
        <p class="index-intro-p">
          In the late 1990s, Will Vinton Studios, known for its stop-motion
          films and commercials, sought funds for more feature-length films and
          brought in outside investors, which included Nike owner Phil Knight,
          whose son Travis Knight worked at the studio as an animator. In 1998,
          Knight made his initial investment. In 2002, Phil Knight acquired the
          financially struggling Will Vinton Studios to pursue feature-length
          productions. The following year, Henry Selick, director of The
          Nightmare Before Christmas, joined the studio as a supervising
          director. In July 2005, Will Vinton Studios was rebranded as Laika –
          named after Laika, the dog sent to space by the Soviet Union in 1957.

          At LAIKA, we lean into the hard stuff. Filmmaking is an inherently
          collaborative process that is time-consuming, meticulous, and
          challenging—the very traits that make our work so unique and
          impactful. We strive to reimagine animation by showcasing unique
          voices and hewing to classic stop-motion techniques while embellishing
          them with state-of-the-art technology. We work hard to raise the bar
          and redefine where this art form can take us.

          When Laika was founded in the early 2000s, stop motion animation had
          lost its popular appeal. As a matter of survival in this context,
          Laika animation studio had to carry a meaningful mission with this
          medium. Specifically, the studio aimed to open a new era, to
          invigorate stop motion animation. To do this, we've has integrated new
          technologies and innovations into the 120-year-old technique of making
          stop-motion animation movies. This idea has allowed the animators to
          explore new territories and create ‘movies that matter.’
