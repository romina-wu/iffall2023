                    Hello! I'm Romina Diaz-Rivero (row - MEE - nah). I like to go by Rome too. <br>
                    I'm doing a BFA in Communication Design (Sam Fox) and a minor in Computer Science.
                    I'm currently a junior (Class of 2025).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I plan to get into web development and graphic design as a career, so this class is necessary
                    for me to understand how to make design and function work together. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I do have experience with front end development. I actually interned at a company called Oasis Digital in
                    my freshman year. I mostly did CSS stuff since I use in charge of the design stuff. I would like to hone up
                    on my Javascript skills though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hope to learn more about interactive parts of HTML and learn more about Javascript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I think iterations will be harder since it's easier to replace versions with one file and then if you want to look back at an
                    older version of your work for reference, you'll have to go back and edit a lot of code. Also the fact you look at words and 
                    have no idea what they'll look like till you look at the screen.

                    I like the use of color palettes speaking for themselves and how when you hover over the laptop or the tablet,
                    the title associated with them grows bigger. <br>

                    While the website design could be better, I think it is an effective way of showing the basic information for the 
                    students taking the course. The side nav bar is also useful since it sticks onto every page and has a search function. <br>

                    Effective design and communication. The color palette is one of my favorite things about the website as it gives off
                    tech-y vibes. It's also very easy for anyone of any tech experience to navigate on. <br>
